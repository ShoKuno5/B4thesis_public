\subsection{METHODS}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Digital twins: a recurrent RC neural network with a control
    mechanism, which requires two types of input signals:
    the observational time series for training and the con-trol signal $f(t)$ that remains in both the training and
    self-evolving phase. \begin{itemize}
        \item During the train-ing, the hidden recurrent layer is driven by both the in-
        put signal $u(t)$ and the control signal $f(t)$. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Reservoir updating equations:
    \begin{align}
    \text{training phase: }& \mathbf{r}(t+\Delta t)=(1-\alpha) \mathbf{r}(t) + \alpha \tanh \left[\mathcal{W}_r \mathbf{r}(t)+\mathcal{W}_{\text {in }} \mathbf{u}(t)+\mathcal{W}_c f(t)\right] \\
    \text{self-evolving phase: } & \mathbf{r}(t+\Delta t)=(1-\alpha) \mathbf{r}(t) + \alpha \tanh \left[\mathcal{W}_r \mathbf{r}(t)+\mathcal{W}_{\text {in }} \mathcal{W}_{\text {out }} \mathbf{r}^{\prime}(t)+\mathcal{W}_c f(t)\right]
    \end{align}

    \item $\bold{“sense, learn, and mingle”}$: During
    the training, several trials of data are typically used un-der diﬀerent driving signals so that the digital twin can
    the responses of the target sys-tem to gain the ability to extrapolate a response to a new driving signal that has never been encountered before. We input these trials of training data, i.e., a few pairs of $\mathbf{u}(t)$ and the associated $f(t)$, through the matrices $\mathcal{W}_{\text {in }}$ and $\mathcal{W}_c$ sequentially. 

    \item $\bold{validation/testing}$: the validation of the RC net-works are done with the same driving signals $f(t)$ as in
    the training data. We test driving signals $f(t)$ that are
    diﬀerent from those generating the training data (e.g.,
    with diﬀerent amplitude, frequency, or waveform).  

    \item $\bold{warming-up}$ During the warming-up process to initialize the RC networks prior to making the predictions, we feed randomly chosen short segments of the training time series to feed into the RC network.
    That is, no data from the target system under the testing
    driving signals $f(t)$ are required for making the predic-
    tions.
