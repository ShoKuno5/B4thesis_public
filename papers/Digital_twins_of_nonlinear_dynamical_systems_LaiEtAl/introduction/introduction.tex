\subsection{INTRODUCTION}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Digital twins: through mathematical modeling or data.
    \item Reservoir Computers: self-dynamical evolution with memory / no back-propagation.
    \item $\bold{novelty}$: "Introducing a
    control mechanism into the RC structure with an exoge-
    nous control signal acting directly onto the RC network
    distinguishes our work from existing ones in the litera-
    ture of RC as applied to nonlinear dynamical systems."
    \item $\bold{Purpose}$: "Of particular interest is whether the collapse of the tar-
    get chaotic system can be anticipated from the digital
    twin. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that
    the digital twin so created can accurately produce the
    bifurcation diagram of the target system and faithfully
    mimic its dynamical evolution from a statistical point of
    view. The digital twin can then be used to monitor the
    present and future “health” of the system. More impor-
    tantly, with proper training from observational data the
    twin can reliably anticipate system collapses, providing
    early warnings of potentially catastrophic failures of the
    system"
    \item $\bold{Targets}$: \begin{enumerate}
        \item extrapolation of the dynamical evolution of the target
        system into certain “uncharted territories” in the param-
        eter space
        \item long-term continual forecasting of nonlin-
        ear dynamical systems subject to non-stationary external
        driving with sparse state updates
        \item inference of hidden variables in the system and accurate prediction of their dynamical evolution into the future
        \item adaptation to external driving of diﬀerent waveform
        \item extrapo-lation of the global bifurcation behaviors of network sys-tems to some diﬀerent sizes. 
    \end{enumerate}
